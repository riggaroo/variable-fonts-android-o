# Variable Fonts - Android P Demo

In this sample app, variable fonts are loaded up and some of their properties changed at runtime.

## What is a variable font?
A variable font allows you to specify certain attributes of a font at runtime. Which means you do not need to package multiple font 
files, therefore saving download size. 

## Benefits of Variable Fonts

- Smaller File size to download
- More options baked into a single font
- More powerful font specifications

## Gotchas

- Variable Fonts are only available on Android P and are not yet a part of the Support Library. 
- If you are animating the font between settings, this may cause performance issues
